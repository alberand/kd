Subject: [PATCH] common: fix linked binaries such as ls and true

The ls and true binaries on NixOS are located at different places.
Use 'type -P' and 'realpath' to find out where. Moreover, ls is
actually link too coreutils binary which behave based on file name.
So, make it behave like an 'ls' we need to rename it to 'ls'.
